# Frank's readme file

not sure. do i need a file before a branch? i dont think so. 
turns on if you have no files in the main after creating a repo you can not create a branch

Where are my new notes

What i find most interesting about learning is what I still dont know

git add {file Name}

Add the file to the Head index. this is refered to as a staged file. 

Git reset HEAD {file name} removes the files name from Index. this is refered to as a unstaged file.
